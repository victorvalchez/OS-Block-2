#Given the following program, explain what it prints on the screen and state the reason :

int main () {
  int a=3,pid;          // PID es el process ID, es un integer, la a=3 no sirve de nada
  printf ("Hola\n");
  pid=fork();
  printf ("Adios\n");
}

Prints:
Hola

Adios 
Adios

The reason is that after the fork there are 2 processes (father and son) and, in this case, they both do the same. 
Therefore, both print Adios.
