#ENUNCIADO:
a) Explain the behaviour of the following program. How many times appears each word?
  main (){
  printf ("Hola\n");
  fork ();
  printf ("Uno\n");
  fork ();
  printf ("Dos pid=%d\n",getpid());
  }

b) Which order could they appear?

#SOLUTION:
a) An execution ecample:
    Hola
    Uno
    Dos pid=4530
    Uno
    Dos pid=4532
    Dos pid=4533
    Dos pid=4534
    Â 
    The reason is that every time a fork () is made, two processes appear. Therefore after the first fork () there are 2 processes, 
    which also fork (), resulting in 4 processes (22). Entonces:
    Hola appears 1 vez
    Uno appears 2 veces
    Dos appears 4 veces

El primer proceso ejecuta todo, el seguno proceso ejecuta solo print(uno) y print(dos), y el tercero y el cuarto solo print(dos)

b) The order may vary depending on the order of execution of the processes in each case, which depends on the system scheduler. 
It is recommended to run the example several times to test it
